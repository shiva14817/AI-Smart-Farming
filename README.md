## 🧠 How FarmGenius Works: Advanced Architecture & Intelligence

### Multi-Agent System & Model Context Protocol
FarmGenius uses a **multi-agent architecture** on the backend. Instead of a single AI module, there are multiple specialized agents:
- **Yield Agent:** Handles crop yield predictions.
- **Disease Agent:** Analyzes plant images for disease detection.
- **Market Agent:** Scrapes and predicts market prices.
- **Chat Agent:** Provides conversational AI support for agricultural queries.

**Why Multi-Agent?**
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each agent is focused and easier to maintain/upgrade.
- **Extensibility:** New agents (e.g., weather, pest, soil) can be added easily.
- **Parallelism:** Agents can work independently or together, improving performance and reliability.

#### Model Context Protocol
This protocol allows agents to share context and state for smarter responses:
- **Context Sharing:** Agents exchange info (e.g., user location, crop type, previous queries) to provide holistic answers.
- **Stateful Interactions:** Enables the system to remember past interactions and tailor recommendations.
- **Example:** If a user asks for a yield prediction and then asks about disease risk for the same crop, the Disease Agent can access info from the Yield Agent’s context.

---

### 🤖 AI Vision & Image Analysis
- **Disease Detection:** Users upload crop images. The backend runs a vision model (deep learning or Gemini Vision API) to analyze the image, returning the detected disease, confidence score, and actionable tips.
- **Pipeline:** Image → Preprocessing → AI Model → Analysis → Response

---

### 💬 Multi-Agent Chat Assistance
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro:** The chat agent uses Google’s Gemini model for natural, context-aware conversations.
- **Coverage:** Answers agri questions for all of India.
- **Markdown & Rich Formatting:** Responses are formatted for clarity (bullet points, code blocks, etc.).
- **Streaming & Sharing:** The chat UI supports streaming responses and lets users share conversations.
- **Intent Routing:** The chat agent can delegate queries to domain agents (e.g., yield, market) and aggregate their responses.
- **Context Awareness:** Maintains conversation context for multi-turn dialogues.

---

### 🌐 Real-Time Market Scraping
- **AgMarkNet Scraper:** Fetches live mandi prices for major crops across India.
- **Nationwide Coverage:** Supports all major agricultural markets.
- **Caching:** Avoids excessive requests by caching recent data.
- **Integration:** Market data is used for both chat responses and the market predictor UI.

---

### 🗺️ Yield Prediction with Geospatial Intelligence
- **Google Maps Integration:** Users can select their farm location for precise predictions.
- **Weather & Soil Data:** Uses APIs and default coefficients for region, season, and crop type.
- **Recommendations:** Provides actionable tips along with yield estimates.

---

### 🏗️ Extensible & Modern Architecture
- **FastAPI Backend:** Modular, async, and production-ready.
- **React + Tailwind Frontend:** Beautiful, mobile-first UI with animated transitions.
- **REST API:** Clean, versioned endpoints for all features.
- **Environment Variables:** Secure management of API keys for Gemini, Google Maps, and OpenWeather.

---

**In summary:**
1. **User interacts with the frontend** (uploads image, asks question, selects location).
2. **Frontend calls the backend API** (RESTful endpoints).
3. **Backend routes the request** to the appropriate agent(s) using the multi-agent system.
4. **Agents process the request**, possibly sharing context or fetching external data.
5. **Response is aggregated** and sent back to the frontend.
6. **Frontend displays the result** with rich UI/UX.

---

- **Yield Prediction:** Predict crop yields using AI, Google Maps for location, and weather/soil data.
- **Disease Detection:** Upload plant images to detect diseases using AI models.
- **Market Price Prediction:** Get real-time prices for crops across India via AgMarkNet scraping.
- **AI Chat Assistant:** Ask agricultural questions and get contextual answers (powered by Gemini).
- **Modern UI:** Responsive, mobile-first React + Tailwind interface.
- **Multi-agent Backend:** Extensible system for integrating more AI/ML services.

---

## Architecture
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Vite, React Router, Axios
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, Gemini API, OpenWeather, Google Maps, AgMarkNet Scraper
- **Communication:** REST API (`/api/v1/...`)
- **Multi-Agent System:** Context protocol for extensibility

## How it Works
### Yield Prediction
- User enters crop, area, state, soil, and weather data.
- Optionally selects exact farm location via Google Maps.
- Backend uses crop coefficients, weather, and soil factors to predict yield.
- Returns yield per hectare and total production, plus actionable recommendations.

### Disease Detection
- User uploads a plant image.
- AI model analyzes the image and returns disease diagnosis and management advice.

### Market Prices
- Backend scrapes AgMarkNet for real-time mandi prices across India.
- Data is cached and aggregated for fast, reliable access.

### AI Chat Assistant
- Seamlessly integrated into the platform with a modern, responsive chat UI (matching the overall design system).
- Powered by Gemini 1.5 Pro for natural, conversational, and context-aware responses.
- Supports Markdown formatting, streaming replies, and sharing of conversations.
- Understands context from other features (e.g., yield, market, disease) for truly smart, multi-turn assistance.
- Designed specifically for Indian agriculture: covers all major crops, regions, and agri practices.

### Multi-Agent System
- Backend is built to allow easy addition of more AI/ML agents and features.
